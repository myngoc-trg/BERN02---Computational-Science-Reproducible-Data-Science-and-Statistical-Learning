    "##### Interpretation of the results\n",
    "1. The posterior mean of the intercept ($\\beta_0$) is $0.427$ with a 90% credible interval of $[-0.285, 1.082]$. This represents the log-odds of towel reuse in the control group (baseline category) averaged across all studies. The positive value indicates that, on average, there is a tendency towards towel reuse in the control group.\n",
    "    - On the probability scale, this corresponds to a mean probability of towel reuse of approximately $60.5%$ (calculated as \n",
    "        $$\\frac{1}{1 + exp(-0.427)}$$\n",
    "        ), with a 90% credible interval of approximately $[42.9\\%, 74.7\\%]$. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Group effect for social $\\beta_1$ posterior mean = $0.208$ with positive credible interval $[0.081, 0.336]$, which indicates evidence that the social-norm intervention increases towel reuse.\n",
    "    - On the probability scale, adding $0.208$ in log-odds increases the mean probability of towel reuse to approximately $65.4%$ (calculated as \n",
    "        $$\\frac{1}{1 + exp(-(0.427+0.208))}$$\n",
    "        ), with a 90% credible interval of approximately $[62.4\\%, 68.2\\%]$. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Study random effects $study_i$\n",
    "    - $\\sigma = 1.114$ shows certain variation between studies in baseline reuse probability.\n",
    "    - Individual study intercepts $study_i$ shifts the slope up and down for each study. The intercepts differ between studies, justifying the hierarchical (random intercept) model.\n",
    "        - Study 3, 4 and 7 both have credible intervals that contain $0$, suggesting baseline reuse probability in these studies may not differ significantly from the overall average. However, study 7's increble interval barely includes $0$, we cannot conclusively say it differs from the overall baseline.\n",
    "        - Study 5 has the highest positive deviation ($1.130$), meaning higher baseline reuse probability.\n",
    "        - Study 1 has the largest negative deviation ($-0.943$), meaning lower baseline reuse probability."
